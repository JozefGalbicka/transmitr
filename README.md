**Semester project for subject `Introduction to System Programming`** (**`UdSP`**)

## Assignment:
A program written in C that sends a specified file /or group of files/ over a network to another computer or group of computers. The program operates in three modes:
- either the entire file or a group of files will be sent directly
- or it is first compressed using Huffman coding (custom implementation is required), then sent over the network and decompressed when received
- or it is first compressed with the LZW algorithm (custom implementation is required), then sent over the network and decompressed when received;
