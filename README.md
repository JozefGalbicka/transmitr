**Semester project for subject `Introduction to System Programming`** (**`UdSP`**)

## Assignment:
A program written in C that sends a specified file /or group of files/ over a network to another computer or group of computers. The program operates in three modes:
- either the entire file or a group of files will be sent directly
- or it is first compressed using Huffman coding (custom implementation is required), then sent over the network and decompressed when received
- or it is first compressed with the LZW algorithm (custom implementation is required), then sent over the network and decompressed when received;

## Notes
- This project is just a Proof of Concept, feel free to make your entire business dependent on it
- Project structure is inspired by [The Pitchfork Layout](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork)
